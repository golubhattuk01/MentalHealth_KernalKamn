Interactive Quiz Module
Objective: Develop an interactive quiz module that assesses users' mental health and provides personalized feedback and suggestions.

Features:

Quiz Creation: Use Python to generate dynamic quizzes that adapt based on the user’s previous responses and mental health history. Questions will cover emotional well-being, stress levels, sleep patterns, and more.

NLP Analysis: Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze open-ended responses. This could involve sentiment analysis and keyword extraction to understand the user's emotions and concerns more deeply.

Feedback and Suggestions: Based on quiz results, provide personalized feedback and actionable advice. If the user shows signs of distress or needs immediate attention, the system could suggest contacting a professional or exploring therapeutic activities.

Technology Stack:

Python Libraries: Use libraries like NLTK or spaCy for NLP tasks, and Flask for backend API development.
Database: Store user responses and quiz results in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for longitudinal tracking.

User Progress Tracking and Reporting
Objective: Create a module to track and visualize user progress over time, offering insights into their mental health trends.

Features:

Data Tracking: Each user's quiz results and chat interactions are logged and analyzed. Key metrics (e.g., mood swings, anxiety levels) are tracked over time.

Graphical Visualizations: Implement visual tools using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly in Python to create intuitive graphs and charts that display the user’s progress and fluctuations in their mental health state.

Monthly Reports: Automate the generation of comprehensive monthly reports that summarize the user's mental health status, improvements, areas needing attention, and compare current results with previous months.

Professional Suggestions: Based on the tracked data and quiz outcomes, offer recommendations for physical activities or lifestyle changes. Include an option to connect users with mental health professionals for further consultation.

Technology Stack:

Python Libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib/Plotly for data visualization.
Backend Framework: Django or Flask to handle data processing and user management.
Integration:

Both the quiz module and the tracking/reporting module will integrate seamlessly, ensuring data flows smoothly between user interactions and backend analytics. This integrated approach will facilitate a holistic view of each user’s mental health journey and enable targeted interventions.

This framework aims to empower users by providing them with insights into their mental health and actionable advice to enhance their well-being.
